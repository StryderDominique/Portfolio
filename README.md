# Portfolio
Coding Portfolio for Employers to look at.


Hello! This is my portfolio.

Little about me: My name is Stryder Dominique and I have been coding since I got a computer when I was 12, I am now 18 and have skills in python, c++ Html, java, and SQL

My best language is python and I have been pursuing python as a hobby for a while. I have taken classes at Grossmont community college and in combination with youtube and personal for-fun projects I have become pretty good at using python. 

I think my favorite memory of python was when I was first learning it I decided I wanted to do a project and make my own AI like Jarvis. It was ambitious but I had a lot of fun and ended up making a GUI with my friend that was capable of opening applications and interfacing with the user. 

Currently, I work as a CAD designer and I have been enjoying that a lot. The job is fun and it challenges me to think, but ultimately I think my passion is working with people and programming. I plan to pursue a life as a code developer or maybe one day own my own company that deals with tech.
